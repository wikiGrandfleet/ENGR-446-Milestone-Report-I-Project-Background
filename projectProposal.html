<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><em>What have other people done on this topic? What can you do to improve it? Describe the domain information of the topics being studied. You may also include a brief literature review of related research in the domain. The literatures can come from a variety of sources: journal articles, conference proceedings, government reports, technical reports, etc.</em></p>
<p>Building a simple networked game that has a server client interaction requires knowledge of the client-server architecture, software development and how to set up a server.</p>
<h1 id="project-summary">Project Summary</h1>
<p><em>Describe the problem (either theoretical or domain specific) that will be addressed by the project.</em> In this project, a simple 2D arcade style 2 player platform game will be implemented using web technologies like JavaScript. The player will be able to land jump onto platforms, move only in the game area and be able to move around endlessly.</p>
<h1 id="interactive-game-logic">Interactive Game Logic</h1>
<p><em>What are the characteristics of the study area, especially those characteristics that prompted you to choose this area? Explain the expected data to be used. If data need to be collected, before the proposal is submitted, include preliminary research exploring data availability or estimating the cost of producing these data within the period of the project.</em></p>
<p>Initially, when the first player connects to the server, the background will be loaded and the player is free to explore the game environment. When a second player connects, they will spawn in the same location and be free to move around. If any player disconnects their sprite will be deleted. The game will display a message when both players reach the desired objective.</p>
